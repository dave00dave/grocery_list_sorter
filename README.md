# shopping_list_sorter

This program helps you to make shopping lists in the order in which the items are arranged in the store. This saves time when shopping by reducing backtracking through the store.

To use it, create a "store file" that contains all of the items that you normally buy at a particular store. The store file should be a csv, and the items in it should appear in the order that they're arranged in the store. Then start the program, load the store file, make your list, and enjoy your extra free time!

If anyone actually makes another list, please push it to a new branch on this repo and PR it so others can use it too.

## Emailing Lists
If you provide a file named "credentials.txt" that contains credentials from which an email can be send, the Send Email button will be activated. credentials.txt must consist of an email address on the first line, the password on the second line, and nothing else.
